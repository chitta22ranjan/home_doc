What is Ingress network, and how does it work?

Ingress network is a collection of rules that acts as an entry point to the Kubernetes cluster. 
This allows inbound connections, which can be configured to give services externally through reachable URLs,
load balance traffic, or by offering name-based virtual hosting. So, Ingress is an API object that manages external
 access to the services in a cluster, usually by HTTP and is the most powerful way of exposing service.
